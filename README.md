# macOSrecon

This is a collection of Python scripts that poke around inside macOS to find information about the hardware it supports.

Clone this repo from github, and run `./recon.py`, then `git status`. If you see any modified files, you have probably discovered newer hardware support than the last person who committed!
Send us a PR with your discoveries :)
